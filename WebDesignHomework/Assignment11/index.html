                Have you ever struggled marketing your music to the world? Marketing music can be a huge
                challenge in todays age, especially with how much content is floating around out there. Tik Tok,
                Youtube, and Instagram are all over-saturated with non-musical videos, making musical content 
                get drowned out too easily.
