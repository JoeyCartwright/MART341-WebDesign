# trending.html

### **Required Techniques (Must Have):**

- Create a page with an external CSS style sheet

I now have style.css and fonts.css. Both serve as styling for my webpage.

- Add hover effects to enhance interactivity

In trending.html, there is now a hover feature over the title in order to make it pop.

- Use an external font that is self-hosted

I found a woff font and coded it in using the @font-face method. It doesn't make too great of a change, but it makes my webpage look cleaner in my opinion.

- Use an external font from a font library

I found a roboto font using the @ url method. This font looks really nice, especially for my smaller text in my body.

### **Select at Least Three Additional Techniques:**

- Experiment with different font styles

I experimented with Georgia and Roboto. I chose to go with Roboto as I thought it looked nicer on my webpage.

- Adjust font-weight for emphasis

One of my titles is larger when you hover over it, creating a pop out affect.

- Align text or elements for a clean layout

My webpage is aligned in the middle. I think this makes it look as clean as it can be. I would change the layout if I were to continue adding to my webpage.
