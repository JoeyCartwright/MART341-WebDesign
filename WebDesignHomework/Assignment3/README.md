# Assignment 3 README file
## **Topic of Choice:** *Noting anything in particular you learned that you would like to discuss further?*

I have studied computer science for a little over 3 years now and I never knew that fiber cables connected the world for international internet usage. I find it highly fascinating that people were able to connect these cables across oceans. It is also cool that the entirety of the internet uses the same rules and concepts, so internet can always be used across participating nations. I also find it cool that the interenet will always be scalable and realiable (for the most part).

One thing I would like to discuss/research further would be where fiber cables don't reach. I would like to see a map of all the cabels and study why these places have not recieved cables yet. I think plotting data could also prove useful in order to provide more insight. 

### **In Summary**

*Things I found intersting:*
- cable networks
- reliability
- scalability
