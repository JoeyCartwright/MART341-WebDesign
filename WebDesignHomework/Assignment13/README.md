# Continued Version of my Music Marketing Webpages.
---------
### REQUIRED TECHNIQUES:

- At Least 4 Pages – Your website should contain a minimum of four distinct pages that align with a cohesive theme.

I continued my music marketing webpages. There are 5 pages all designed with css.

- Responsive Design – Ensure the website layout adjusts smoothly across different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, and mobile).

My website does transfer smoothly. I checked on my phone and although it doesn't look as good as my labtop, it is usable.

- Media Queries – Use CSS media queries to make design adjustments at specific screen widths for optimal user experience on all devices.

I make sure to adjust the screen width to the device width. 

- Navigation Menu – Include a clear, user-friendly navigation menu to allow visitors to easily access each page of the site.

I included a navigation menu on my home page. Each page has a url button to take you back to the home page.

- Dropdown Menu – Add a dropdown menu within the navigation for sub-pages or sections, if applicable.

I just used my navigation menu to get across pages. There is not much content on any of my pages, so I do not believe there is a need to jump around the page.
