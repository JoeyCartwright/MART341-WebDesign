# Final Fall 2024 Joey Cartwright 
## Continued Version of my Music Marketing Webpages.

--------

### Incorporate Required Elements:

- MAJOR CHANGES: 

1. Positioning my pages menu in the top left of my home page. This allows it to pop out, so users know how to access the other pages immediately. 
2. Changing my highlight class, custome-headers class, and bootstrap class to match the aesthetic of each box element's content. 
3. Commented my HTML code thoroughly
4. Making small changes to text, title, and headers. These changes include: format, font, padding, spacing, and positioning. 

- Three or more pages.

1. contact page - Interactive contact form for future account creation.
2. credits page - giving credit for my background image.
3. music page - uploading clips of audio, video, and iframes.
4. index page - home page that can access all other pages and shows a description of the website.
5. trending page - table for top trending songs of the month. 

- A clear, well-organized layout with strong usability.

Almost everything is centered in an understanding layout. There is a return home button at the bottom of each page. Each page has a title that describes the page's purpose.

- Use of an external stylesheet.

I use an external css sheet, font sheet, and java script file.

- Apply at least one font.

I have a couple fonts applied using my fonts stylesheet and by using bootstrap url. They add a professional look for the website. I aim to keep consistency of professionalism by using aesthetically pleasing fonts. 

- At least one image (preferably your own or fair-use images).

I use an image for my background. I also use an image in my trending page which is given an alt and title. 

- At least one embedded media element (video, audio, Google Maps, etc.).

Under my music page, I have two audio clips, two video clips, and a YouTube Iframe.

- Structural and semantic HTML markup with a clean and organized page layout.

My code is easily readable and indented correctly, making for legible code. My website is built using HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, BOOTSTRAP, and HTML5.

- Legible, well-commented, and error-free code.

All my code runs correctly and my website does not crash. All HTML code is well-commented. All code is indented correctly.
