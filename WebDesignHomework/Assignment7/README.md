# Reflection

----

I am quite proud of most of my work. I am really putting in a decent amount of effort in this website because I want to continue building upon it, even after class. 

If I had to choose one thing I am proud of, I would choose my alignment. It took me awhile to center everything the way I wanted to. It was giving me a lot of problems. Thankfully, it taught me how styling works within html. I now have a much deeper understanding of how to style each element seperately and how that works in general. 

One thing I would like to do next week is to make my images align horizontally. I got pretty burnt out, and figured it would be a good accomplishment for next week. I am assuming it is quite easy, so I am excited to achive this goal. I am also excited to create more functionality within my webiste. I want to make it so people can actually make profiles and upload clips of their songs!
