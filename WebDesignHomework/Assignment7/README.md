# Reflection

----

I am quite proud of most of my work. I am really putting a decent amount of effort into this website because I want to continue building upon it, even after class. 

If I had to choose one thing I am proud of, I would choose my alignment. It took me a while to center everything the way I wanted to. It was giving me a lot of problems. Thankfully, it taught me how styling works within HTML. I now have a much deeper understanding of how to style each element separately and how that works in general. 

One thing I would like to do next week is to make my images align horizontally. I got pretty burnt out and figured it would be a good accomplishment for next week. I am assuming it is quite easy, so I am excited to achieve this goal. I am also excited to create more functionality within my website. I want to make it so people can make profiles and upload clips of their songs!

ALSO! Feel free to check out the songs on my trending.html page. I thought it was cool that I could link my songs in a clean format. Of course, that page is meant to display trending songs, but I thought was cool that I could link actual material. It makes the website feel more alive and makes me excited to develop more.
