# Music Marketing Website

---

I want to create a website that functions as a marketing tool for musical artists. 
Artists will be able to upload clips of their songs, along with a video attached 
in order to gain the attraction of anyone using the website. I want the website to 
look professional and clean. I hope to style the website with black background and orange
and white text.

## Reflection 

- Balancing my website to look neat was extremely easy using html and css. I experimented with the
width and margin, but not as much as I would like to. Next week, I plan on experimenting more with width and margin. Color design was a huge game changer. I was able to make the website look how I pictured it in my head. The background color also helped my webpage display the way I wanted it to. The text and headers were able to pop out. There is still room for improvement, but I learned that it is quite easy to make simple and affective style choices. 
- The final design turned out exactly as I was expecting. I know there is much room for improvement, so I didn't have anything crazy planned out in my head. I want to experiment with formatting and alignment during the coming weeks. 
- I did not experiment with float or margin. 
- I did not encounter too many issues while creating my index file. This is not the first class that I have used html and css, so my skills are already somewhat developed. I hope to challenge myself as I build more upon my website!
