### **Required Techniques (Must Have):**

- Sizing: Control the width and height of elements on the page.

I changed the height in my .highlight to make the contact box look nice.

- Border: Define and style borders around elements for emphasis or separation.

I changed the border style to ridge. I thought it makes it look really sharp.

- Margin: Adjust the space outside an element, creating separation from other elements.

I adjusted the margin so that the writing inside the box doesn't get too close to the edge. 

- Padding: Set the space inside an element, between its content and border.

I adjusted the padding to give more cushion for the contents of the box. I thought this made it look more put-together even though it is a really small change.

- Display: Inline / Inline-block:  Specify how elements are displayed in relation to others.

I put my display to inline-block. This is defintitely the better alternative since I am putting input and words inside a box.

- Position: Control the placement of elements with properties like absolute, relative, or fixed.

I adjusted my position to static. This made a pretty small change as well, but it is good to know where my box is positioned.
