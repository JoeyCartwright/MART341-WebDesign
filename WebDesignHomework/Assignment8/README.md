# Reflection

----

- Div (at least 2)

I used <div> eliments to seperate my audio and video clips on music.html. This helped me organize my content horizontally stacked on top of each other

- Span (at least 2)

I used <span> eliments to add my audio and vidoe under my <div> calls. This helped me format them the way I wanted to, side by side. 

- Audio (at least 1)

I used the <audio> tag to include two of my songs. I still need to center the audio files in my span boxes. 

- Video (at least 1)

I used the <video> tag to include 2 clips of live preformances. I was able to format them with my desired width and height.

- Iframe (at least 1)

I used the <iframe> tag to upload one of my first youtube videos. The sharp edges made it look displayable and nice.

- Class (at least 2)

I used <class> tags to identify correct boarder widths and heights so that they fit my audio/video correctly. Of course, there is still room for improvment.

- Escape character (at least 1)

I used &copy; to copyright the title of my Website! This made it look more official.
