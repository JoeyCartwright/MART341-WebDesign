# README List:

### Designate which page you're working on this week (e.g., **faq.html**) I am building upon my week 8 website. I will be modifying the following

- contact.html
- credits.html
- index.html
- music.html
- trending.html

#### **Required Techniques (Must Have)**:

- Create a page with an external CSS style sheet

I created my external css file and put it within a folder. I used a class = highlight to describe a lot of my divs.

- Use at least 1 class selector

Highlight one - three describe different divs throughout my page depending on their height and width.

- Use at least 1 ID selector

I used one ID selector in my **trending.html** to bold a header

#### **Select at Least Three Additional Techniques**:


- Different background colors

Style.css now has my background picture and color.

- Different font colors

I changed all my fonts using the *. I changed to something that looks somewhat like arial and times new roman.

- Positioning

My style sheet positions all of my content in the middle

- Opacity

Did not do opacity

- Text Alignment

Text is aligned in the middle

- Borders

class highlight one - three has black and white borders

- And more (feel free to experiment!)
