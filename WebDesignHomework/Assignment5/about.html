<h1>Why I Chose These Website Ideas</h1>

<h3>Refurbished Version of Soundcloud</h3>

<p>I chose this idea becasue I am very passionate about music. I also feel that it could 
    be easier for independant artists to market their music through a well developed website.
    I feel like this could be a really cool thing to add to my resume as well!

<h3>Personal Blog</h3>

<p>This idea would be the easiest for me to impliment. I would definitely do this one if I really wanted 
    to spend time on css. The functionality of a blog is quite simple, so I would be able to devote lots of
    time into the websites colors and format.

<h3>Monkeys Dancing</h3>

<p>This idea just popped into my head randomly. Although it seems simple, I feel like it would be a lot
    of work that I would not be ready for. It would also be a challenge to mantain the website and to get 
    new ideas for songs and dance moves. It would also be a challenge running into copyright rules.
