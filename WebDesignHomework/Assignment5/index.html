<h1>Examples for Potential Websites</h1>

<a href="about.html">If you wish to learn more about my website ideas!</a>

<h3>Refurbished Version of Soundcloud</h3>

<p>This webiste would be more on the professional side. People would be able to upload clips of their
    songs to this website in order to market their music. This could give independant artists a better 
    chance at competing with larger labels.
    <br>I feel like I will end up pursuing this one

<h3>Personal Blog</h3>

<p>This website would be more on the lighthearted side, and definitely calming. It would be a personal
    blog of my weekly thoughts. <br>I probably won't do this one to be honest. It could be fun though, 
    and much more simple than my first idea.

<h3>Monkeys Dancing</h3>

<p>This webiste would be purely playful. It would of course be a webpage of dancing monkeys.
    Each day, they could have a new dance and a new song. <br> I definitely won't be doing this idea 
    since I don't know how to animate monkeys. However, it could be fun, and I could even throw a 
    donation link to help endangered species or something of that matter.
