# Continued Version of my Music Marketing Webpages.
### Required Techniques (Must Have):

--------

- 3+ Pages – The website should contain multiple pages with a cohesive theme.

    All 4 pages can be access through my home page. Each page has a link to take you back to the home page. All pages are themed for music marketing.

------

- Framework Integration – Incorporate a CSS framework of your choice (e.g., Bootstrap, Foundation) to enhance design and layout.

    I chose to use bootstrap. I figured this would be a good choice due to all of its upsides. I linked bootstrap using this url in my header. 
"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.0-alpha3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"

----------

- Framework Styling Elements – Use predefined styling components from the chosen framework for consistency and visual appeal.

    I used bootstrap to enhance my div boxes. I added shadow elements and ensured that the width and centering was correct.
You can see my use of bootstrap in my index.html file

---------

- HTML5 Canvas – Include an HTML5 canvas element to display custom graphics or animations.

    I used HTML 5 to draw a music note using the canvas call.

    canvas id="musicCanvas" width="200" height="200"

----------

- JavaScript Functionality – Add JavaScript to enhance interactivity or perform dynamic actions on the site.

    I created a new folder for javascript code. I linked my javascript file under my canvas call. ChatGPT helped me draw a music note. I understand javascript well, I just didn't know what exact numbers/calculations were needed for a music note. It turned out quite nice!
