- **Explain how web browsers function. How do web browsers really work behind the scenes?**

   *Web browsers must function using an index.html file. A server is used to host all the files which run the web browser. Once there is proper server response, the browser can read files and folders such as html, css, javascript, etc.* 

- **What is the DOM (Document Object Model), and how does it power your web pages?** 

   *DOM parses through the html. You can think of its course as tree with branches and leaves. DOM can be manipulated using javascript.*

- **HTML, XML, XHTML—what sets them apart?**

   *HTML is the most common of these three. All three are hypter text markup langauges. HTML is much more leniant when it comes to error in format or code, XML is much more strict. This can be nice because some browsers may not react well to unstructure HTML. XHTML is a mix between the two. It doesn't take forever to code, but it does have more structure than basic HTML*

- **What are the four essential elements every HTML page needs?**

   1. HTML
   2. Head
   3. Title
   4. body 

- **What’s the purpose of the index.html page, and where should it be placed?**

   *Index.html should alwasy be placed in the root folder. It tells the browser where to go so that specific names don't have to be specified when typing in the web browser.*

- **Review: What are the top naming practices for clean and organized code?**

   1. Don't start with numerics
   2. No spaces
   3. Camal case is good
   4. Use - instead of _
   5. Use lower case for file names (preference)
   6. Stay consistent with structure and naming
